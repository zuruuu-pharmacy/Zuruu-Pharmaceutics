Examples include cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and carmustine. They are cell cycle non-specific, meaning they can kill cells in any phase."

        front: "When are antimetabolites most effective?",
        back: "Antimetabolites are most effective during the S phase of the cell cycle when DNA synthesis is occurring. They work by competing with normal metabolites for enzyme binding sites, leading to the production of non-functional DNA and RNA. Examples include methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, and cytarabine."

        front: "What is the lifetime dose limit for doxorubicin?",

This property is unique among alkylating agents and makes it valuable for central nervous system malignancies. It's administered intravenously and can cause delayed myelosuppression."

It can also cause myelosuppression, alopecia, and electrolyte imbalances. Pre-treatment hydration and antiemetics are essential."

This reduces vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion, leading to decreased blood pressure and cardiac workload. Examples include enalapril, lisinopril, and captopril."

        front: "Why are beta-blockers contraindicated in asthma?",

This can worsen asthma symptoms and potentially cause life-threatening bronchospasm. Selective beta-1 blockers like metoprolol are preferred in patients with respiratory conditions."
